To Do
======

Move sorter:
1. 64bit array = score+bitmap
2. best move slot for updating tree

Move generator:
1. Quiescence move generator
  - find just capture moves or promotion
  - evaluate the best move
  - evaluate all moves until no captures
2. bitboard
  - pawn position move generator
  - implement bitboard storage IPosition
  
Bitboards:
1. pawn position - hash pawns (lazy)
  - eval 
  - move gen
2. knight position - hash knights (lazy)
  - OR black to find captures
  - OR white to find legal
  - lookup in hashtable to find moves left (from_to_piece bitmaps)
3. king position
4. Rook, Bishop, Queen
  - Magic number

5. Black coverage, White coverage
  - quick check lookup
  - quick mobility calculation
  
6. Is it possible to use moves generated from previous pos ?
